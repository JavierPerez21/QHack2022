    "The game is collaborative between two parties, Alice and Bob, who are given two random bits x and y, where x is known by Alice and y is known by Bob. Alice and Bob will additionally select two values, a and b, which can be 0 or 1, and will win if $x · y=a \\oplus b$ where $\\oplus$ represents addition modulo 2. Since the probability of x · y = 0 is 75%, the best classical strategy is that both of them previously agree on choosing either a, b = 0, 0 or 1, 1, ignoring the bits they received.\n",

To do this we need to complete the functions `prepare_entangled` which prepares $|\\psi\\rangle$, `chsh_circuit` which simply implements Alice's and Bob's measurements based on the optimal angles and x and y, `winning_prob`which calculates the probability of winning based on the selectad angles, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ and lastly `optimize` which finds the optimal angles to use for a given entangled qubit pair $|\\psi\\rangle$."
