    "The [Elitzur-Vaidman bomb tester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitzur%E2%80%93Vaidman_bomb_tester) is a quantum algorithm that evidences one of the weird features of quantum mechanics that come from superposition. This algorithm is a thought experiment that allows us to verify if a bomb is functional without triggering it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is based on beam splitters that are represented by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U_{BS}(\\theta) = R_y(2\\theta)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and it works in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A photon travels through the beam splitter\n",
    "2. We sample the photon and force it to go through one of two paths depending on its state after sampling ($|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$). \n",
    "3. A bomb is placed on the $|0\\rangle$ path. If the bomb goes through it, and the bomb is live, it will explode with probability equal to the probability of the photon sampling returning $|0\\rangle$. If the bomb is a dud, the photon can travel freely through the $|0\\rangle$ path.\n",
    "4. Several beam splitters are connected with their outputs conencted to the next beam splitters inputs.\n",
    "5. At the end of the circuit there are 2 detectors C and D. If there is no functional bomb present, only detector C will beep. However, if there is a genuine bomb, and if the bomb does not explode, either detector may beep. Thus, if detector D beeps at all, we have detected a real bomb without exploding it! But if detector C beeps, we cannot say anything about the bomb.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this challenge is to calculate the number of bombs that can be certified as functional without detonating them. By adjusting $\\theta$ and chagnging the number of beam splitters, this number can be adjusted."
